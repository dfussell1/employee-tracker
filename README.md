  ## Description
  This repository contains code for a simple command-line tool that allows users to track their employee's information across a database. After installing dependencies and starting the app, a user is prompted with a variety of options. They can view all departments, view all employees, view all employee roles, add a department, add a new role, add a new employee, or update an employee's role. Each option displays or updates the database with the given information provided by the user.
